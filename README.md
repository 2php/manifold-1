# Manifold
Manifold is a model-agnostic visual debugging tool for machine learning.

Understanding ML model performance and behavior is a non-trivial process, given intrisic opacity of ML algorithms. Performance summary statistics such as AUC, RMSE... are not instructive enough for identifying what went wrong with a model or how to improve it.

As a visual analytics tool, Manifold allows ML practitioners to look beyond overall summary metrics to detect which subset of data a model is inaccurately predicting. Manifold also explains the potential cause of poor model performance by surfacing the feature distribution difference between better and worse-performing subsets of data.
